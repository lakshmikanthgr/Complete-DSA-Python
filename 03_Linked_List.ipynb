        "  1. Single Linked List: Each node points to the next node.\n",
        "  2. Double Linked List: Each node contains pointers to both next and previous node.\n",
        "  3. Circular Linked List: The last node points to the first node and makes a circular structure.\n",

        "## Advantages of Linked list:\n",
        "  1. Dynamic size : Memory is created based on need.\n",

        "  3. Flexibla data storage: Element can be stored in non-contigous memeroy.\n",

        "## Cons:\n",
        "  1. Need extra memory(for pointers.)\n",
        "  2. Sequential access: Random access is not possible. You need to traverse from start to access element.\n",
